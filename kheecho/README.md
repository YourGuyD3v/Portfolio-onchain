# 🪶 Idea Summary — OnChain Capture

**Tagline:** “Capture moments. Mint instantly. Own forever.”

---

## 🧠 Concept
**OnChain Capture** is a decentralized photo NFT platform that lets users **capture or upload photos instantly and mint them as NFTs** — directly on-chain.  
It acts like an **on-chain photo gallery** (similar to Google Photos, but decentralized) where users can store, showcase, and trade their memories.

## 🌐 Core Features

- 📸 **Instant Minting** — Capture or upload a photo → click *Mint* → NFT instantly created.  
- 🖼️ **On-Chain Gallery** — Personal gallery for each user, like a decentralized photo app.  
- 💰 **NFT Market Actions** — Buy, sell, fractionalize, auction, or donate NFTs.  
- 🔒 **Decentralized Storage** — Images stored on **IPFS/Arweave/Filecoin**; metadata on-chain.  
- ⚡ **Gasless Transactions** — Powered by meta-transactions or account abstraction.  
- 🌍 **Multi-Platform Access** — Accessible via web and mobile (PWA).  
- 🎨 **x402 UI/UX Layer** — Smooth, modern interface for crypto and non-crypto users.  
- 🔑 **Multiple Login Options** — Wallet (Web3Auth), email, or social sign-in.

## 💡 Mission
To make **minting NFTs as easy as taking a photo** — empowering creators, photographers, and everyday users to **own, share, and monetize** their digital memories securely on-chain.
